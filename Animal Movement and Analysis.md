This repository focuses on analyzing animal movement metrics using GPS telemetry data. Using R packages like amt and move, the analysis explores spatial and temporal variations in movement, identifying key behaviors such as migratory, resident, and dispersal movements.

Key Features of This Repository
Movement Data Processing: Handling and cleaning GPS data for movement analysis.
Trajectory Analysis: Extracting movement metrics, including step length, turn angles, and displacement.
Spatial Patterns: Investigating how environmental and anthropogenic factors influence movement.
Fine-Scale vs. Large-Scale Movement: Comparing migration, dispersal, nomadic, and resident movement.
Visualization Tools: Creating interactive maps and movement plots using R and GIS tools.

Whatâ€™s Inside?
Data Preprocessing: Scripts to clean and format GPS tracking data.
Movement Metrics Calculation: Step length, turn angle, NSD, displacement.
Spatial Analysis: Eulerian vs. Lagrangian movement models.
Visualization: Animated maps and movement paths using ggplot2, leaflet, and amt package.
Example Datasets: Test datasets from real-world telemetry studies.
